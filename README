  I have not tried this yet in a real hot end, simply as a dry run
  with the selectra beside my printer. Once I have, I will update further

Settings and macros used to setup the Protea Design Selectra on ths Anycubic 
Kossel Linear Plus using the Duet 2 WiFi.


The conversion to a Duet 2 WiFi was done based on a series of excellent posts
made here: http://danalspub.com/2018/07/anycubic-kossel-linear-plus-to-duet3d-part-1/


The basis for the tool change code was taken from the samples provided by
Protea Design. I tried to modify them into a tool change script that would
work on the Duet.

Below is a brief explanation of what each file is for:

config.g
    * This contains the modifications I made to my config.g.
    * It defines 5 tools (0-4) and sets up a new axis (axis C for cam shaft).
    * The new axis will be used to select the filament we are extruding.
    * Motor stall detection is also setup so the selector can be auto-homed.

tpostN.gcode
    * This is a file that needs to be duplicated for each tool.
    * It runs after a new tool has been selected.
    * Note, all axis must have been homed for this code to be run by Duet.
    * This selects the new filament by moving the cam selector, then runs the
        load macro, followed by the prime macro. It then restores the location
        of the print head to where it started.

tfreeN.gcode
    * This is a file that needs to be duplicated for each tool.
    * It runs when a tool has been deselected (ex, switching from T0 to T1).
    * This macro moves to the prime bin location, and retracts the filament to
        before the selector.

homec.gcode
    * Required homing file for new axis.
    * It handles homing the cam shaft / selector.
    * On a delta the homedelta.g file is run for homing, if all axis are not
       homed, it will also run the specific script for the remaining axis. In
       our case axis C.

MACROS

load.gcode
    * Pushes filament from before the selector into the hot end.

unload.gcode
    * Pulls the filament back out of the hot end and to before the selector.

movetoprimebin.gcode
    * Moves the print head to the location of the prime bin

prime.gcode
    * Extrudes a specfic amount of filament to ensure clean colour switch
